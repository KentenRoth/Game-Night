# Game-Night

This is the front-end of my monopoly finance program.  

I am building this with React, and looking to get a better grasp on Redux.

Currently this is still in the early stages.  I am closing to implimenting Redux.  I have also looked into other ways of state management, but feel like putting in more time to learn Redux is the best choice as of now.
