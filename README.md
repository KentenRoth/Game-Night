# Game-Night

This is the front-end of my monopoly finance program.  

I am building this with React.  I was going to impliment Redux with this project, but I feel like I should start a little smaller on the project scale when trying to get a better grasp on Redux

This is a project that I felt would allow me to impliment some of the new things I have been learning with React, and help me with building out a larger project.

The reason behind building this program is because I wanted to make monopoly a little faster.  It seems like making change and running out of hundreds was always an issue.  So with this there is no more making change, and its as fast as clicking a button and getting the next roll off.
